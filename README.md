# ReactNativeBasicsApp
Simple ToDo App made during the React Native course.

Detail descripion: 

In this very simple Todo app we can see by default some todos already added. This is because of testing of "useState" hook and working with state at all. In the very top we have a option to add todo to the list. When we click on todo itself we can delete this todo from the list. For this simple project is not used JSON server or stuff like this. Just some hardcoded initial data for todos and a possibility to add more todos or to delete existing ones.

If you want to start the application you have to have NodeJS on you machine. You should have also Android Studio installed and created Virtual Device to see the app in action. When you have that you can open the project and can write in the terminal the command "npm install". This command will install all needed package dependencies needed for project. When this is done, you can write "npm run android" /don't forget to start the Android emulator first/. In the project are showed: working with state, working with props, working with React Native components, etc.
